        { question: "What is the main purpose of Activity-Based Costing (ABC)?", choices: ["To simplify cost allocation for all products", "To provide accurate estimates of the costs of services and products", "To group costs into general cost pools", "To eliminate all indirect costs"], correct: 1 },
        { question: "In ABC, what is a cost driver?", choices: ["The total cost of a product", "A factor that influences the costs of an activity", "A unit of production", "A direct labor cost"], correct: 1 },
        { question: "Which step is first in implementing the ABC method?", choices: ["Calculate the unit cost of the cost driver", "Allocate indirect costs to products", "Specify the activities", "Choose an allocation base"], correct: 2 },
        { question: "What is a key advantage of the ABC method?", choices: ["It simplifies cost calculations for large-scale production", "It faithfully models the complexity and provides good cost traceability", "It reduces the need for cost drivers", "It eliminates the need for database updates"], correct: 1 },
        { question: "What is a disadvantage of ABC?", choices: ["It is less accurate for service industries", "It is complex to create and update databases", "It ignores indirect costs", "It is not suitable for manufacturing industries"], correct: 1 },
        { question: "In job order costing, what is considered a custom order?", choices: ["A product that is mass-produced", "A service initiated by the management", "A product or service with characteristics defined by the customer", "A standardized product with no customization"], correct: 2 },
        { question: "What type of costing is best suited for industries that produce large quantities of identical goods?", choices: ["Job order costing", "Process costing", "Direct costing", "Standard costing"], correct: 1 },
        { question: "In job order costing, how are indirect costs allocated to a specific job?", choices: ["They are directly traced to the job", "They are distributed based on a cost driver", "They are ignored in job costing", "They are only calculated after the job is completed"], correct: 1 },
        { question: "What is the contribution margin in the CVP model?", choices: ["The difference between total fixed costs and total sales", "The difference between total revenue and variable costs", "The difference between total revenue and fixed costs", "The total profit after deducting all costs"], correct: 1 },
        { question: "The break-even point is the point at which:", choices: ["Total revenue equals total costs", "Fixed costs are minimized", "Variable costs are zero", "Sales exceed fixed costs"], correct: 0 },
        { question: "In CVP analysis, what does the margin of safety represent?", choices: ["The difference between the actual sales and the sales needed to break even", "The total profit margin of the company", "The additional costs required to produce one more unit", "The percentage of sales lost before reaching the break-even point"], correct: 0 },
        { question: "What is a major limitation of the CVP model?", choices: ["It requires advanced accounting systems", "It assumes constant selling prices and linear costs", "It ignores variable costs", "It cannot be used for decision-making"], correct: 1 },
        { question: "In Activity-Based Costing (ABC), how are indirect costs allocated to products?", choices: ["Based on a cost driver specific to the activity", "By equally distributing the total costs across all products", "By tracking only direct labor costs", "By reducing the number of activities involved"], correct: 0 },
        { question: "What is the final step in the ABC method?", choices: ["Specify the activities involved", "Calculate the unit cost of the cost driver", "Allocate indirect costs to products based on their consumption of units", "Choose an allocation base"], correct: 2 },
        { question: "Which of the following is not an assumption of the CVP model?", choices: ["All costs can be classified as fixed or variable", "Sales price per unit is constant", "Costs are affected by multiple factors", "Production efficiency remains constant"], correct: 2 },
        { question: "Which method is typically used for customized projects in job order costing?", choices: ["Process costing", "Job costing", "Standard costing", "Activity-based costing"], correct: 1 },
        { question: "How are internal orders defined in job order costing?", choices: ["They are initiated by management to complete a specific task", "They are customer-driven and based on specific requirements", "They are used to allocate costs to mass-produced items", "They are ignored when calculating job costs"], correct: 0 },
        { question: "What is the primary difference between job order costing and process costing?", choices: ["Process costing is for mass production, while job order costing is for customized jobs", "Job order costing uses indirect cost allocation, while process costing does not", "Process costing only applies to services, not goods", "Job order costing focuses on variable costs only"], correct: 0 },
        { question: "In CVP analysis, what does the contribution margin ratio indicate?", choices: ["The percentage of sales revenue that exceeds variable costs", "The fixed cost per unit produced", "The sales required to break even", "The variable costs per unit"], correct: 0 },
        { question: "Which of the following is an application base in job order costing?", choices: ["Direct material costs", "Labor hours", "Sales revenue", "Inventory turnover"], correct: 1 }
